Astronomical Calculations inspired by Mike Brown's "Science of the Solar System" course

## Leighton and Murray

I have revisited Leighton and Murray's "Behavior of Carbon Dioside and Other Volatiles on Mars"

 * planet.py  Repository for basic data about planets
 * solar.py   Model for solar irradiation, based on Solar Radiation on Mars, Joseph Appelbaum & Dennis Flood, Lewis Research Center, NASA 
 * slices.py  Slices of Mars' interior
 * mars-temperature-model.py  Driver program
 * utilities.py Miscellaneous utility fucntions
 * viewer.py  Used to plot data files from mars-temperature-model.py

### TODO

 * The daily and yearly position of the sun   Largely complete (areocentric longitude needs to be related to date)
 * Heat flow into and out of the subsurface   Largely complete
 * The effect of condensation and evaporation on the energy balance
 * The total amount of volatile at the surface at each point in time
