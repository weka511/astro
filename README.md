Astronomical Calculations inspired by Mike Brown's "Science of the Solar System" course

## Leighton and Murray

I have revisited [Leighton and Murray's Behavior of Carbon Dioside and Other Volatiles on Mars](http://www.mars.asu.edu/christensen/classdocs/Leighton_BehavioCO2_science_66.pdf)

 * solar.py   Model for solar irradiation, based on Solar Radiation on Mars, Joseph Appelbaum & Dennis Flood, Lewis Research Center, NASA 
 * thermalmodel.py  Slices of Mars' interior, togther with model for heat flow
 * utilities.py Miscellaneous utility fucntions
 * viewer.py  Used to plot data files from mars-temperature-model.py

### TODO

 * The effect of condensation and evaporation on the energy balance
 * The total amount of volatile at the surface at each point in time
